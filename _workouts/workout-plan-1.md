## Welcome

As I mention in my CV I love sports. I've been practicing sports since I was a young boy. Nowadays I am just swimming and doing Calisthenics, which is bodyweight training. In this next series of posts, I'll leave here my workouts. Bear in mind that I have not been working out a while. It has been tough to manage time between my thesis, my laziness among other things XD. 

Now let's begin!!

My idea with this post is to write my workout for this next few days. 

## Workout characteristics:

Workout time | 25 minutes
Workout type | Full body workout

## *Workout plan

### 1. 10 push ups
### 2. 5 pull ups
### 3. 15 squats
### 4. 5 burpees with jump
### 5. 15 secs of skipping

Repeat everything 3 times and that is it! Between sets, I rest for about 1 minute.

See you soon, **thank you!**
